# ERater
Repository for NLP final project

We will use this branch for working on our project

- To set up working eclipse environment, perform the following steps:

1) install Egit:
   - go to eclipse > help > install new software 
   - in the area named work with: type EGIT
   - click on the link that appears
   - click select all
   - finish installation
   - Restart the eclipse to get the changes
   
 2) Setting up github project
   - got to package explorer
   - Right click > select import 
   - In the list, expand Git, select projects from git, select clone URI
   - Get the URI from your github account (this has to be done after forking your online repo)
   - input your details
   - while selecting branch, select shared and change remote nane from origin to shared as well
   - finish the next steps
   
3) Setting up working java project
   - The above setup only fetches the project from github. But, never really sets up the working java project. 
   - To setup one, delete the project from the available package explorer. Yes!! You read it correct!! 
   - Before deleting, make sure "delete contents from disk" is unchecked
   - click on file > new java project 
   - uncheck "use default location"
   - in Location: add the path where github project was extracted in step 2.
   - Usually, the project is found C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\git\ERater
   - Click finish
   - When your run the project, it runs

4) Congratulations !! Continue coding.
